# List of cookiecutter templates

This directory contains a list of cookiecutter templates I use for my personal projects.

To create a new template, use `make template` in the root of this directory and rename the output directory.

Use the folders in the `templates` directories as normal cookiecutters.

## TODO

- [ ] Create a cli-tool cookiecutter: for creating CLI tooling
